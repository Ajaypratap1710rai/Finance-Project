    <h1>Welcome to Ganesh Finance Limited Company</h1>
    <p><b>
        Ganesh Finance Limited Company provides loans for an individual for their needs. It offers a wide variety of loans like auto finance, house loan, gold loan, loan against property etc. 
Ganesh Finance has branches all over the country in all major cities. Ganesh Finance advertises, typically through newspapers and TV shows. 
Ganesh Finance offers maximum loans for less interest, relatively little higher than other banks. Customers produce required documents to avail a specific loan. 
The loan amount will be credited to their personal bank account once the loan is approved. Refund of loan will be through ECS, post dated cheques or by directly paying cash in the branch. Upon request, the bill collectors from the company also visit to customer place and collect the due amount.
At present, the Loan processing is done manually with its employees. Recently there were lots of problems regarding the document processing and verification and customers were unhappy because of a long waiting time for getting the loan even though the customer had submitted all the required documents.
Ganesh Finance is also planning to reduce the labor costs by automating  to Loan application process, where one are two  employees can do document processing and approval.
